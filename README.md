# Secure File Sharing
SecureShare is a secure file-sharing platform that allows users to upload, encrypt, and share files safely. The system uses AES-256 encryption to ensure file security, and download links are generated with 24hr expiry to prevent unauthorized access. The project aims to address issues with secure file sharing and how it can be applied in educational institutions.

V2 aimed to improve the UI with color pallete changes, enhanced the upload pipeline and added a step of malware scanning for the files that are being uploaded. Additionally, developed an activity log that records and logs all user actions improving the security posture of the application.
