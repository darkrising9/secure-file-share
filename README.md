# Secure File Sharing
SecureShare is a secure file-sharing platform that allows users to upload, encrypt, and share files safely. The system uses AES-256 encryption to ensure file security, and download links are generated with 24hr expiry to prevent unauthorized access. The project aims to address issues with secure file sharing and how it can be applied in educational institutions.
